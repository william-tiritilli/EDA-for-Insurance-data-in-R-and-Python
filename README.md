# EDA-for-Insurance-data
In this repo, we will present some aspects of the data exploration in Insurance and the steps to consider before starting a predictive model to estimate claims frequency or claims cost, aka severity. We will share some code in both R and Python to calculate main KPI’s and compute visuals that helps to understand how the predictors interact with each other and get some hints on their potential predictive value.
# Data
The data set in use is in the repo. It comes from the chapter one of the book “Predictive Modelling Applications in Actuarial Science, Vol.2”, Edited by E. Frees et al..
Here is a quick description of the fields, where 'clm.count' is the number of claims and 'clm.incurred' is the claims cost. These are the two outcome variables that we will focus on.
